To build a FIREBrick you need:

* ASRock E350M1 Motherboard
* >= 1Gb DDR3 Desktop RAM (1333 or 1066)


This version of the FIREBrick has the possibility to be extended with extra software, through a USB-stick. A module is a filesystem image which is mounted in to the FIREBrick. Before the module is mounted it is checked if it can be trusted by verifing the md5hash of the image and compare is to the stored hash in the module definition file which is digitally signed.

This build needs a little more work, currently has basic working functionality.
